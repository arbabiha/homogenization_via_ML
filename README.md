# homogenization_via_ML
Efficient data-driven learning of the homogenized PDEs from data

Combination of equation-free methods and machine learning for data-driven discovery of homogenized equation as detailed in *"Linking Machine Learning with Multiscale Numerics: Data-Driven Discovery of Homogenized Equations"*, by H. Arbabi, J.E. Bunder, G. Samaey, A.J. Roberts and I.G. Kevrekidis, 2020


## main files:

**1d_example** loads the patch-dynamics data for 1d heterogeneous diffusion problem, learns the effective coarse-scale PDE from that, and compares it to the homogenized PDE solution. The data is included in 'thehood' folder but one can regenerate the data by running 'generate_data_1d.py' in 'thehood' folder.

**2d_example** loads the gap-tooth data for 2d heterogeneous diffusion problem, learns the effective coarse-scale PDE from that, and compares it to the homogenized PDE solution. Data for this problem must be generated by running the matlab file 'generate_data_2d.mat' in 'thehood' folder.


## multi-scale methods for generation of training data

The 1d data is generated by the patch dynamics code written by [Giovanni Samaey](https://giovannisamaey.wordpress.com/). For a discussion of the method see the paper [here](http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/publicaties/rapporten/tw/TW411.pdf) 


The 2d data is produced using the [equation-free MATLAB package][https://github.com/uoa1184615/EquationFreeGit] of [Anthony Roberts][http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/] and coworkers. See the user manual in there.
